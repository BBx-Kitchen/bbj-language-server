# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-02)

**Core value:** BBj developers using IntelliJ get the same language intelligence they have in VS Code — syntax highlighting, error diagnostics, code completion, run commands, and Java class/method completions — through a single shared language server.
**Current focus:** Planning next milestone

## Accumulated Context

### Known Issues

1. Structure View symbol kind differentiation — labels, variables, and fields all show same icon (SymbolKind.Field) due to BBjNodeKindProvider default case. Language server issue.

### Tech Debt

- Run command output not captured in IntelliJ console tool window
- EM credentials stored as plaintext in settings
- BbjCompletionFeature depends on LSPCompletionFeature API that may change across LSP4IJ versions

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
