# Project State: BBj Language Server

**Last Updated:** 2026-09-20 (v4.4 IntelliJ Focus archived — release 0.16.0 shipped, override closeout)

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-20)

**Core Value:** BBj developers get consistent, high-quality language intelligence — syntax highlighting, error diagnostics, code completion, run commands, and Java class/method completions — in both VS Code and IntelliJ through a single shared language server.

**Current Focus:** Planning next milestone — run `/gsd-new-milestone`

Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-09-20 — Milestone v4.5 started

## Performance Metrics

### Cumulative

**Started:** 2026-02-01
**Milestones shipped:** 21
**Phases completed:** 95
**Plans completed:** 349
**Days elapsed:** 231
**Velocity:** ~1.5 plans/day (lifetime); v4.4 ran at ~9 plans/day over its 4 phase-work days

Per-plan duration tables for phases 72-97 are archived with their phase artifacts under
`.planning/milestones/v4.2-phases/`, `v4.3-phases/` and `v4.4-phases/`.

### Recent History

**v4.4 (Shipped: 2026-09-20):**

- Duration: 7 days (roadmap 2026-09-17, phase work 4 days)
- Phases: 5 (93-97)
- Plans: 36 (101 tasks)
- Key: all 21 GitHub milestone #7 IntelliJ issues closed — eleven behaviour fixes (composer EDT guards and server-verdict OK gating, honest java-interop status, EM login cleanup and enablement, cached TextMate bundle, one Node.js decision engine attested on real Windows) and ten consolidations; shipped as release 0.16.0 through the verify-before-publish gate; a crash-detection rework was reverted before release; override closeout, no milestone audit (6 artifacts acknowledged). IntelliJ JUnit 865 → 1,101.

**v4.3 (Shipped: 2026-09-13):**

- Duration: 8 days
- Phases: 9 (84-92)
- Plans: 70 (174 tasks)
- Key: all 23 GitHub milestone #5 issues fixed in code — config path honored everywhere with hot-reload, IntelliJ targeted Java refresh and port auto-detect, composer cues in both IDEs plus SETOPTS-in-code and CVS() composers, composer robustness on both hosts, language-server responsiveness, host-side hygiene; milestone audit `tech_debt` with no gaps; override closeout (21 artifacts acknowledged). All phases now on `origin/main`.

**v4.2 (Shipped: 2026-09-06):**

- Duration: 3 days
- Phases: 6 (78-83)
- Plans: 25 (74 tasks)
- Key: Every open PRIO 1/2 IntelliJ issue (22) closed in code — EDT responsiveness, fail-closed EM token handling with owner-only temp files on Windows, `bbj/compile` on the shared language server, composer stale-edit guard, JDK 17 toolchain and pinned wrapper, IntelliJ JUnit suite 96 → 504; landed on `origin/main` via PR #651

## Accumulated Context

### Active Constraints

- Disclosure constraint: no v4.1 planning artifact on `main` may describe a flaw mechanism, affected file, or exploitation path for any of the 8 unpublished advisories — opaque GHSA-id-only references only. Remediation research (`SECRETS-AND-EXEC.md`, `SUPPLY-CHAIN.md`) stays untracked via `.git/info/exclude`.
- New work lands via a branch cut from `origin/main` plus a pull request, with a per-commit register check of the source diff for planning identifiers (plan/D-xx/C-xx/COMP/CR-xx tokens) before push.
- Anything both IDEs need stays a host-neutral language-server request — no reimplementation on the IntelliJ side.
- No live IntelliJ UI test coverage exists in CI. Verification pattern is plain-Java seams under plain JUnit 5, whole-file source guards for IDE-only wiring, and hand UAT in a running IDE per phase — build both distributables first, and again from the final tree after code-review fixes.
- bbj-notifications.ts isolation module must be preserved — importing main.ts from shared services crashes tests
- 3 parser.test.ts assertions DISABLED — require a Java classpath unavailable in the EmptyFileSystem test environment
- TEST-03 (DEF FN suffix completion) skipped — Langium grammar follower limitation

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md's Key Decisions table; per-phase decision detail for phases 70-97
is archived with the phase directories (v4.1 embargoed off `main`; v4.2-v4.4 tracked). Standing
decisions:

- [v4.1, standing]: No CVE is requested for any advisory during implementation; CVE and severity are decided by the maintainer at publication time (a deliberate PROC-03 departure).
- [v4.1, standing]: Whole-suite regression gate is project-wide `numFailedTests: 0` plus deterministic targeted-file runs, not a failing-suite identity delta (DEBT.md item 5).
- [v4.4, standing]: IntelliJ consolidations ship as an abstract base plus thin no-arg subclasses, never a runtime-keyed "data-driven" single class — every per-kind difference stays compile-time checked.
- [v4.4, standing]: A runtime status or lifecycle sequence used as UAT evidence must come from a real `idea.log`, not a hand-derived trace (the Phase 97 crash-detection rework was approved on a wrong trace and reverted).
- [v4.4, standing]: IntelliJ whole-suite gates run with `--rerun-tasks` (or `cleanTest test`); a plain `test` can report UP-TO-DATE and mask a stale green.
- [v4.4, standing]: Before a squash merge, scan the branch's commit bodies for closing keywords — PR #679's squash closed #621/#594 early.

### Tech Debt

- CPU stability mitigations documented but not yet implemented (#232)
- LSP4IJ experimental API usages remain (expected, requires LSP4IJ to stabilize); fenced since Phase 83
- BbjCompletionFeature depends on LSPCompletionFeature API that may change
- IntelliJ TextMate bundle cannot exclude config.bbx at filename level (adjacent to PLAT-01)
- FQN path static-only filtering deferred — requires JAR redeployment
- Static method return type inference gap — String.valueOf(2) does not assign type

### Pending Todos

4 pending in `.planning/todos/pending/`, all filed 2026-09-20 and acknowledged at the v4.4 close:

- `2026-09-20-lost-language-server-connection-is-invisible-to-crash-detection` — severity major; the Phase 97 attempt was reverted
- `2026-09-20-status-transition-log-prints-a-stale-previous-status` — only makes sense together with the one above
- `2026-09-20-phase-97-code-review-follow-ups` — partial download-progress fix, three weak source guards
- `2026-09-20-linking-interop-failures-survive-class-warmup` — root cause found (hermetic test double), not fixed

### Blockers/Concerns

- **9 advisory fixes merged and released, not yet published.** The tagged release publication was waiting for exists (`v0.16.0`, 2026-09-20). Per-advisory severity/CVE decisions are the maintainer's; post-release checklist in MILESTONES.md under v4.1.

- **`WINDOWS.md` entry 1 open** (Phase 70 guardrail breadth, accepted as unmet 2026-08-21). With `workflow.windows_enforce` on, this blocks `/gsd-ship` until fixed or explicitly waived. Entry 3 (Phase 96 Windows attestation) is fixed.

- **0.15.0 stays half-released** (VS Code only) — deliberately not reconciled (SEED-002); 0.16.0 is on both marketplaces. `manual-release.yml`'s two publish jobs still run in parallel; the by-hand runbook is `milestones/v4.4-phases/97-release-0-16-0-milestone-close/97-RECONCILIATION-RUNBOOK.md`.

- **Crash detection cannot see a lost language-server connection.** LSP4IJ detaches the client before it publishes `stopped`; the Phase 97 fix failed hand UAT and was reverted. Accepted `86-05-REVIEW` WR-01 is the same defect. Upstream: LSP4IJ #1672/#1673.

- **Test-harness false positive.** `shouldRunBBjTests()` (`test/test-helper.ts`) gates on a bare TCP connect to :5008, so with BBjServices up 11 `linking.test.ts` interop tests switch on and fail. The issue447 capability test was rewritten backend-agnostic in 97-03, so the documented local baseline of 12 should now be 11 (not re-measured at close); green with `RUN_BBJ_TESTS=0`. Tracked in `.planning/DEBT.md`.

- **Advisory review follow-ups still open:** `89-REVIEW` WR-01 (VS Code composer primary button always says "Insert"); `90-SECURITY` T-90-11 (`ComposerHandleCache` has no source guard forbidding a static map); `86-05-REVIEW` WR-02 (no exception handling around the bounded restart wait); `97-REVIEW` WR-01..WR-04 (todo filed). The `79-REVIEW` IN-02, `83-REVIEW` WR-02/WR-04 and `82-UI-REVIEW` colour items were retired by v4.4 phases 93, 94 and 96.

- Full inventory of items needing a human decision: `tmp_human_review/` (untracked).

detail for phases 70-97 live with their archived phase artifacts; this file is a digest again.*

## Operator Next Steps

- Run `/gsd-new-milestone` to define the next milestone; phase numbering continues from 98. Candidates are listed in PROJECT.md under Next Milestone Goals.
- Maintainer-owned: advisory publication (PROC-03) is now unblocked by tag `v0.16.0`.
- Small follow-up candidate: the published 0.16.0 release notes list #622 under "no observable change", but the fix visibly changed the crash banner's file-type coverage.
- Carried forward: triage the UAT-log issues #659-#662 and the SETOPTS discoverability follow-up #666.
- `WINDOWS.md` entry 1 still blocks `/gsd-ship` under `windows_enforce`.
