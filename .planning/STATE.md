## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v2.0 start]: Langium 3 to 4 upgrade -- no new features, clean migration only
- [v2.0 start]: Keep chevrotain ~11.0.3 pin (compatible with Langium 4.1.x)
- [14-01]: Tilde version ranges (~4.1.3, ~4.1.0) for consistency with project convention
- [14-01]: Generated files remain gitignored (regenerated at build time)

### Known Issues

1. Structure View symbol kind differentiation -- SymbolKind.Field default case (deferred from v1.1)

### Tech Debt

- EM credentials stored as plaintext in settings
- BbjCompletionFeature depends on LSPCompletionFeature API that may change across LSP4IJ versions

### Blockers/Concerns

None.
