## v1.1 Polish & Run Commands (Shipped: 2026-02-02)

**Delivered:** Brand icons, run commands (GUI/BUI/DWC), Structure view, and all 7 carried-forward v1.0 bug fixes — bringing the IntelliJ plugin to feature parity with VSCode for daily development workflows.

**Phases completed:** 7-10 (6 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- BBj brand icons (file, config, plugin listing, run actions) with light/dark theme support harvested from VSCode SVGs
- Run BBj programs as GUI/BUI/DWC directly from IntelliJ with toolbar buttons (Alt+G/B/D shortcuts) and bundled web.bbj runner
- Document outline / Structure view via LSP DocumentSymbol with click-to-navigate
- REM comment toggling, bracket matching, and LSP hover placeholder suppression
- 30-second LS shutdown grace period preventing disruptive restarts on file switches
- Completion popup icons using platform AllIcons.Nodes with Java-interop distinction

**Stats:**

- 35 files created/modified
- 3,808 lines of Java (plugin source, cumulative)
- 4 phases, 6 plans
- 1 day from v1.0 ship to v1.1 ship (2026-02-01 → 2026-02-02)

**Git range:** `a0acf5d` → `620db16`

**What's next:** TBD — semantic tokens, find references, rename refactoring, Marketplace publication, or new milestone
