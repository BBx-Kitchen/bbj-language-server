## Cross-Phase Integration

### Risk: DEAD-02 Import Cleanup (Phase 55 → Phase 54)

When Phase 55 removes `checkCastTypeResolvable` from `bbj-validator.ts`:
- **Safe to remove:** `MethodCall` import, `isLibFunction` import (only used by deleted code)
- **MUST RETAIN:** `BbjClass` import (line 11) — required by `checkUsedClassExists` (line 328, added by Phase 54 for TEST-04)

Accidental removal of `BbjClass` would silently break TEST-04.

### Note: TEST-03 and Phase 55 HARD-01

Phase 55's test hardening work (HARD-01) touches `parser.test.ts`, not `completion-test.test.ts`. No direct conflict with the TEST-03 skip. However, Phase 55 should be aware of the documented Langium grammar follower limitation before touching any completion-related tests.

---

## Tech Debt

| Phase | Item | Severity |
|-------|------|----------|
| 54 | TEST-03 skipped — Langium grammar follower doesn't resolve completions inside MethodDecl.body | Low (user accepted) |

---

## Test Suite Baseline

```
Test Files: 21 passed (21)
Tests: 501 passed | 4 skipped (505)
Duration: 7.33s
Exit: 0
```

Phases 55 and 56 must preserve this baseline.
