# v3.9 Quick Wins — Milestone Audit

**Milestone Goal:** Fix reported bugs, add missing grammar verbs, and close quick feature gaps (static methods, constructors, deprecated indicators).

**Audited:** 2026-02-20
**Status:** gaps_found
**Reason:** Phase 59 (Java Class Reference Features) not started — 4 requirements unsatisfied

---

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Plans | Verification |
|-------|------|--------|-------|--------------|
| 57 | Bug Fixes | ✓ Complete | 2/2 | passed (11/11 must-haves) |
| 58 | Grammar Additions | ✓ Complete | 2/2 | passed (7/7 must-haves) |
| 59 | Java Class Reference Features | ✗ Not Started | 0/TBD | missing |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

| Requirement | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | REQUIREMENTS.md | Final Status |
|-------------|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| BUG-01 | EM Config "--" startup fix | 57 | SATISFIED | 57-01: listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| BUG-02 | config.bbx plain text | 57 | SATISFIED | 57-01: listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| BUG-03 | Suffixed identifier parsing | 57 | SATISFIED | 57-02: missing | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| BUG-04 | DECLARE in class body | 57 | SATISFIED | 57-02: missing | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| GRAM-01 | EXIT with numeric arg | 58 | SATISFIED | 58-01: listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| GRAM-02 | SERIAL verb | 58 | SATISFIED | 58-02: listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| GRAM-03 | ADDR verb expression | 58 | SATISFIED | 58-02: listed | `[x]` | **satisfied** |
| FEAT-01 | .class resolution | 59 | missing | N/A | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |
| FEAT-02 | Static method completion | 59 | missing | N/A | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |
| FEAT-03 | Deprecated strikethrough | 59 | missing | N/A | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |
| FEAT-04 | Constructor completion | 59 | missing | N/A | `[ ]` | **unsatisfied** |

**Orphaned requirements:** None — all 11 requirements are assigned to phases.

## Cross-Phase Integration

| From | To | Via | Status |
|------|----|-----|--------|
| Phase 57 token fixes | Phase 58 grammar | Shared bbj-token-builder.ts / bbj.langium | WIRED — no dependency between phases; both modify shared infrastructure independently |
| Phase 57 RELEASE LONGER_ALT | Phase 58 EXIT_NO_NL LONGER_ALT | Same Chevrotain pattern | WIRED — EXIT_NO_NL follows same CATEGORIES/LONGER_ALT approach |
| Phase 57 ClassMember union | Phase 58 grammar additions | bbj.langium shared file | WIRED — Phase 58 modifies different grammar rules, no conflict |

**Integration score:** 7/7 wiring verified for completed phases. No orphaned exports. No missing connections.

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| DWC launch with "--" classpath | Settings → stripSentinel → runWeb() → no -CP-- | Complete |
| BUI launch with "--" classpath | Settings → stripSentinel → runWeb() → no -CP-- | Complete |
| GUI launch with "--" classpath | Settings → stripSentinel → run() → no -CP arg | Complete |
| IntelliJ DWC with "--" classpath | Settings → inline guard → empty classpath | Complete |
| IntelliJ BUI with "--" classpath | Settings → inline guard → empty classpath | Complete |
| config.bbx file opens in VS Code | Extension → configurationDefaults → plaintext | Complete |
| EXIT 0 / EXIT 1 parsing | Source → EXIT_NO_NL token → ExitWithNumberStatement → AST | Complete |
| SERIAL "file.dat" parsing | Source → 'SERIAL' keyword → SerialStatement → AST | Complete |

**Flow score:** 8/8 E2E flows verified for completed phases.

## Tech Debt

### Phase 57: Bug Fixes
- IntelliJ TextMate bundle cannot exclude config.bbx at filename level — IntelliJ users must override in Settings > File Types
- BbjRunDwcAction and BbjRunBuiAction duplicate sentinel guard inline instead of calling getClasspathArg() — redundant but functional

### Phase 58: Grammar Additions
- EXIT myVar (letter-starting variable) parses as bare EXIT + separate ExpressionStatement — accepted trade-off to avoid flow-control keyword ambiguity
- Pre-existing TypeError in check-variable-scoping.ts line 63 ($refText undefined) — from Phase 28, not introduced by Phase 58

**Total:** 4 items across 2 phases (all non-blocking)

---

## Unsatisfied Requirements Detail

All 4 unsatisfied requirements belong to **Phase 59: Java Class Reference Features**, which has not been planned or executed.

- **FEAT-01**: `.class` property on class references resolves to java.lang.Class (#373)
- **FEAT-02**: Static method completion on class references via USE statements (#374)
- **FEAT-03**: Deprecated methods show strikethrough indicator in completion items
- **FEAT-04**: Constructor completion for `new ClassName()` expressions

These are feature additions, not bug fixes. The milestone goal describes them as "quick feature gaps."
