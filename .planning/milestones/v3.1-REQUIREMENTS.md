## v1 Requirements

Requirements for v3.1 PRIO 1+2 Issue Burndown. Each maps to a GitHub issue.

### Scoping & Variable Resolution

- [x] **SCOPE-01**: Variables only visible after declaration/initialization in program scope (#4) — Validated: two-pass offset-based detection with 16 tests
- [x] **SCOPE-02**: DEF FN parameters scoped correctly inside function expression/body (#226) — Validated: 4 tests (3 visibility + 1 non-leakage)
- [x] **SCOPE-03**: Super class field access via `#field!` resolves through inheritance chain (#240) — Validated: 3 field inheritance tests
- [x] **SCOPE-04**: DREAD recognizes variables already declared by DIM (array subscript form) (#247) — Validated: 3 tests with ArrayDecl guard
- [x] **SCOPE-05**: DECLARE type information applies to variable usage before the DECLARE statement (#265) — Validated: 6 tests with whole-scope visibility

### Java Interop & Linking

- [x] **JAVA-01**: Methods inherited from Java super classes resolve correctly when invoked via `#method()` or `#super!.method()` (#85) — Validated: implementation uses Class.getMethods() (human verification pending)
- [x] **JAVA-02**: Recently-added Java methods (e.g. setSlot()) found by reflection (#180) — Validated: getMethods() includes interface default methods

### Parser & Validation

- [x] **PARSE-01**: DEF FN inside class methods doesn't trigger line-break validation error (#226) — Validated: multi-line DEF FN test passes
- [x] **PARSE-02**: Cyclic reference error messages include source filename and line number (#245) — Validated: Error severity with file:line info and related information

### File Type & IDE

- [x] **IDE-01**: .bbx files treated as BBj programs (same icon, language handling, and run support as .bbj) (#340) — Validated: both VS Code and IntelliJ

### Extension Settings

- [x] **CONF-01**: config.bbx path and other BBj options configurable in extension settings (#244) — Validated: bbj.configPath with hot-reload
- [x] **CONF-02**: Interop hostname and port configurable (not hardcoded to localhost:5008) (#257) — Validated: bbj.interop.host/port in both IDEs
- [x] **CONF-03**: EM access uses token-based auth instead of storing plaintext password (#256) — Validated: SecretStorage (VS Code) + PasswordSafe (IntelliJ)
