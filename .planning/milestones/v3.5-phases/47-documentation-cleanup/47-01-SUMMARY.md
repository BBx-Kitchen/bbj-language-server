# Phase 47 Plan 01: Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Removed stale roadmap page and restored strict broken link checking, fixing internal link format bugs in the process**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1min 56s
- **Started:** 2026-02-09T19:55:41Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-09T19:57:37Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4 (1 deleted, 3 modified)

## Accomplishments
- Deleted outdated roadmap.md with stale Eclipse/JavaDoc/build automation references
- Restored onBrokenLinks to 'throw' for strict link validation (was 'warn' during Phase 44 restructuring)
- Fixed broken internal links in VS Code and IntelliJ guide index pages
- Verified clean Docusaurus build with zero broken links

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Delete roadmap page and restore strict link checking** - `19f8c09` (chore)
2. **Task 2: Verify clean sidebar and build the docs site** - `6ec388d` (fix)

## Files Created/Modified
- `documentation/docs/roadmap.md` - Deleted (contained stale content)
- `documentation/docusaurus.config.ts` - Changed onBrokenLinks from 'warn' to 'throw'
- `documentation/docs/intellij/index.md` - Fixed broken links to use intellij/page format
- `documentation/docs/vscode/index.md` - Fixed broken links to use vscode/page format

## Decisions Made
- Restored strict link validation (onBrokenLinks: 'throw') now that Phase 44 directory restructuring is complete
- Fixed link format bugs discovered when strict checking was enabled

## Deviations from Plan

### Auto-fixed Issues

**1. [Rule 1 - Bug] Fixed broken internal links in index pages**
- **Found during:** Task 2 (Building docs site)
- **Issue:** IntelliJ index used `./getting-started` format, VS Code index used `./getting-started.md` format. Both resolved incorrectly causing 404s when onBrokenLinks: 'throw' was enabled. Build failed with "Docusaurus found broken links!"
- **Fix:** Changed IntelliJ index links from `./page` to `intellij/page` format. Changed VS Code index links from `./page.md` to `vscode/page` format (removed .md extension, added category prefix)
- **Files modified:** documentation/docs/intellij/index.md, documentation/docs/vscode/index.md
- **Verification:** Docusaurus build succeeded with exit code 0, no broken links reported
- **Committed in:** 6ec388d (Task 2 commit)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 auto-fixed (Rule 1 - bug)
**Impact on plan:** Bug fix was necessary for Task 2 build verification to succeed. The broken links existed before this phase but were masked by onBrokenLinks: 'warn' setting. Restoring strict checking exposed them. No scope creep.

## Issues Encountered
None - deviation handled automatically per Rule 1

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Documentation cleanup complete
- All stale pages removed
- Strict link validation active and passing
- Ready for final milestone completion

## Self-Check: PASSED

**File Existence:**
- roadmap.md deleted (correct)
- docusaurus.config.ts exists
- intellij/index.md exists
- vscode/index.md exists

**Commits:**
- 19f8c09 found in git log
- 6ec388d found in git log
