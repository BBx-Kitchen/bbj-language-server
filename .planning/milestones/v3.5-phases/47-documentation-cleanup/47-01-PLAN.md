<objective>
Remove stale roadmap page and finalize documentation site cleanup

Purpose: The roadmap page contains outdated content (references to Eclipse integration, project restructuring, developer guide) that confuses users. The developer guide was already removed in Phase 44. This plan deletes the last stale page and restores the strict broken-link checking that was temporarily relaxed during directory restructuring.

Output: Clean docs site with only VS Code Guide and IntelliJ Guide categories, no stale content, and strict link validation.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Delete roadmap page and restore strict link checking</name>
  <files>documentation/docs/roadmap.md, documentation/docusaurus.config.ts</files>
  <action>
1. Delete the file `documentation/docs/roadmap.md` entirely. This page contains stale content about Eclipse integration, JavaDoc enhancements, project restructuring, and build automation — none of which are relevant to users. It also has a broken link to `/docs/developer-guide/contributing` (the developer-guide directory was removed in Phase 44-01).

2. In `documentation/docusaurus.config.ts`, change `onBrokenLinks: 'warn'` to `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'`. This was temporarily set to 'warn' during the Phase 44 directory restructuring (per decision 44-02). With all restructuring complete and the last stale page removed, strict link checking should be restored to catch any future broken links at build time.
  </action>
  <verify>
- Confirm `documentation/docs/roadmap.md` does not exist: `ls documentation/docs/roadmap.md` should fail
- Confirm `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` is set: `grep "onBrokenLinks" documentation/docusaurus.config.ts`
- Confirm the docs directory only contains vscode/ and intellij/ subdirectories: `ls documentation/docs/` should show exactly 2 directories and no loose .md files
  </verify>
  <done>
- roadmap.md is deleted (CLEAN-01 satisfied)
- onBrokenLinks restored to 'throw' for future safety
- No stale files remain in the docs root
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify clean sidebar and build the docs site</name>
  <files>documentation/docs/vscode/_category_.json, documentation/docs/intellij/_category_.json</files>
  <action>
1. Verify that `documentation/docs/vscode/_category_.json` has position 1 and `documentation/docs/intellij/_category_.json` has position 2. These should already be correct from Phase 44 — this task confirms no stale references exist.

2. Verify the sidebar configuration in `documentation/sidebars.ts` uses `autogenerated` from the docs directory (no manual entries that could reference deleted pages).

3. Run the Docusaurus build to confirm zero broken links and a clean build:
   ```bash
   cd documentation && npm run build
   ```
   The build must succeed with no errors. Since onBrokenLinks is now 'throw', any broken internal link will fail the build — confirming CLEAN-03 is satisfied.

4. Verify the build output does NOT contain a roadmap page:
   ```bash
   find documentation/build -name "*roadmap*"
   ```
   Should return no results.
  </action>
  <verify>
- Docusaurus build succeeds with exit code 0
- No roadmap page in build output
- Sidebar shows only VS Code Guide (position 1) and IntelliJ Guide (position 2)
  </verify>
  <done>
- Developer Guide has no references anywhere in the site (CLEAN-02 confirmed — directory was removed in Phase 44)
- Sidebar and category metadata reflect the new structure with only VS Code and IntelliJ guides (CLEAN-03 satisfied)
- Clean Docusaurus build with zero broken links proves all three CLEAN requirements are met
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After both tasks complete, verify all three CLEAN requirements:

1. **CLEAN-01**: `ls documentation/docs/roadmap.md` fails (file does not exist)
2. **CLEAN-02**: `ls documentation/docs/developer-guide/` fails (directory does not exist — removed in Phase 44)
3. **CLEAN-03**: `grep -r "developer-guide\|roadmap" documentation/docs/` returns no results AND Docusaurus build succeeds with `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'`
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- roadmap.md deleted from documentation/docs/
- onBrokenLinks changed from 'warn' to 'throw' in docusaurus.config.ts
- Docusaurus build succeeds with zero broken links
- No references to roadmap or developer-guide remain in any docs file
- Sidebar shows exactly 2 categories: VS Code Guide and IntelliJ Guide
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/47-documentation-cleanup/47-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
