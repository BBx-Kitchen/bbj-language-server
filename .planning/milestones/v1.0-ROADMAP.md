# Milestone v1.0: Internal Alpha

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-02-01
**Phases:** 1-6
**Total Plans:** 19

## Overview

This roadmap delivered a working IntelliJ plugin that brings BBj language support to JetBrains IDEs by connecting to the existing language server via LSP4IJ. The journey progressed from plugin scaffolding and static syntax highlighting through full language server integration with diagnostics and completions, culminating in Java interop support and cross-platform distribution. Each phase built on the previous, with success measured by observable user behaviors rather than implementation tasks.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Plugin Scaffolding
**Goal**: IntelliJ recognizes BBj files and has a functional plugin structure
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: FOUND-01, FOUND-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition loads the plugin from sandbox without errors
  2. BBj files (.bbj, .bbl, .bbjt, .src) appear with custom icon in Project view
  3. Opening a BBj file creates an editor instance (even without syntax highlighting yet)
  4. Plugin builds successfully via `./gradlew buildPlugin` and produces installable ZIP
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Gradle project setup with IntelliJ Platform SDK
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — BBj file type registration with custom icon

### Phase 2: Syntax Highlighting
**Goal**: BBj code displays with color syntax highlighting via TextMate grammar integration
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: FOUND-03, DIST-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. BBj keywords (IF, WHILE, FOR, etc.) appear in distinct color from identifiers
  2. String literals and comments display in different colors from code
  3. Syntax highlighting appears immediately when opening BBj file (no delay waiting for server)
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — TextMate grammar integration with Gradle sync and bundle provider
- [x] 02-02-PLAN.md — Color Scheme settings page for BBj token customization

### Phase 3: Settings & Runtime
**Goal**: Users can configure BBj environment and plugin detects Node.js
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Requirements**: FOUND-04, FOUND-05, LSI-01, UX-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Settings UI (Preferences > Languages & Frameworks > BBj) shows BBj home path field, Node.js path field, and classpath dropdown
  2. BBj home auto-detects from ~/BASIS/Install.properties and common locations, with manual browse override
  3. Classpath dropdown lists named entries from BBj.properties (e.g., bbj_default, addon); user selects one
  4. Plugin detects Node.js from system PATH, displays version, allows manual path override
  5. Editor banner appears on BBj files when BBj home or Node.js is missing/invalid, with action links
  6. Settings persist as application-level (global) config across IDE restarts
  7. Settings changes auto-restart the language server (Phase 4 will consume these settings)
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 03-01-PLAN.md — Settings state model and runtime detection utilities
- [x] 03-02-PLAN.md — Settings UI page with validation and classpath dropdown
- [x] 03-03-PLAN.md — Editor notification banners and human verification

### Phase 4: Language Server Integration
**Goal**: Core LSP features work end-to-end (diagnostics, completion, navigation, hover)
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Requirements**: LSI-02, LSI-03, LSI-04, LSI-05, LSI-06, LSI-07, LSI-08, LSI-09, UX-01, UX-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Language server process starts when first BBj file is opened, visible in status bar widget
  2. Syntax errors appear as red underlines in editor with hover tooltips explaining the error
  3. Typing triggers code completion popup with BBj keywords, built-in functions, and local variables
  4. Ctrl+Click (Cmd+Click on macOS) on a variable navigates to its declaration
  5. Hovering over a function shows its documentation and signature
  6. Typing function name followed by opening paren shows parameter hints
  7. Changing settings triggers language server restart, reflected in status bar
  8. Closing project cleanly stops language server (no zombie processes remain)
  9. Tools menu includes "Restart BBj Language Server" action that works when clicked
  10. Language server crash triggers balloon notification with error message and restart option
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 04-01-PLAN.md — LSP4IJ dependency, language server bundle, and core LSP classes
- [x] 04-02-PLAN.md — Status bar widget, restart action, and debounced settings restart
- [x] 04-03-PLAN.md — Tool window, crash recovery, notifications, and log level setting
- [x] 04-04-PLAN.md — Human verification of all 10 success criteria

### Phase 5: Java Interop
**Goal**: Java class and method completions work via java-interop service
**Depends on**: Phase 4
**Requirements**: JAVA-01, JAVA-02, JAVA-03, UX-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Language server successfully connects to java-interop service on localhost:5008 at startup
  2. Typing Java class reference triggers completion popup with Java class names from configured classpath
  3. After selecting Java class, typing period shows method completion with Java method signatures
  4. Status bar widget shows java-interop connection state alongside language server state
  5. If java-interop service is unreachable (BBjServices not running), user sees notification explaining BBjServices requirement
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 05-01-PLAN.md — Settings port configuration and java-interop connection health service
- [x] 05-02-PLAN.md — Status bar widget, editor banner, and initializationOptions
- [x] 05-03-PLAN.md — Human verification of all 5 success criteria

### Phase 6: Distribution
**Goal**: Plugin packages for installation on Windows, macOS, and Linux
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Requirements**: DIST-01, DIST-03, DIST-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Plugin ZIP includes bundled language server (main.cjs) in correct directory structure
  2. Plugin ZIP installs via "Install Plugin from Disk" on fresh IntelliJ instance without errors
  3. After installation from ZIP, all Phase 4 and Phase 5 features work identically to development sandbox
  4. Plugin tested and working on macOS, Windows, and Linux environments
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01-PLAN.md — Build configuration, marketplace metadata, and welcome notification
- [x] 06-02-PLAN.md — Node.js on-demand download for systems without Node.js
- [x] 06-03-PLAN.md — Human verification of ZIP install and cross-platform features

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- LSP4IJ over native JetBrains LSP API (Community Edition support)
- TextMate grammar reuse over native IntelliJ lexer (single source of truth)
- Application-level settings (global, not per-project)
- stdio transport for language server communication
- Independent TCP health check for java-interop (not relying on LS reporting)
- Node.js v20.18.1 LTS as bundled download version
- 4-step Node.js resolution: settings > auto-detect > cached download > PATH fallback
- `untilBuild = provider { "" }` for forward IntelliJ version compatibility
- Dual-path resource resolution: lib/ for installed, classloader for development

**Issues Resolved:**
- `untilBuild = "243.*"` blocking IntelliJ 2025.3 (fixed to empty string)
- IntelliJ filetypes.xml `removed_mapping` overriding plugin FileType registration (documented workaround)
- Node.js download requiring IDE restart (added "Restart Language Server" action button)
- java-interop status bar flicker on startup (added grace period and startup suppression)

**Issues Deferred:**
- BbjCompletionFeature orphaned (custom completion icons not wired)
- Comment toggling (BbjCommenter) not functional in testing
- Linux runtime testing (code-complete, not human-tested)
- LS shutdown delay on last file close

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Stale `bbj-intellij/META-INF/plugin.xml` from early phases (no runtime impact)
- `logLevel` not in initializationOptions (sent via didChangeConfiguration instead)
