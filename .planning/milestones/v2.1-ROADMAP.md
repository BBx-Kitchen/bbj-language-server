# Milestone v2.1: Feature Gap Analysis

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Phases:** N/A (research-only milestone)
**Total Plans:** N/A

## Overview

Competitive analysis milestone comparing BBj Language Server against Dynamo Tools VS Code extension. No code phases — deliverable was a comprehensive gap analysis document.

## Deliverable

**Gap Analysis Document:** `.planning/research/DYNAMO-ANALYSIS.md`

Analysis of Dynamo Tools extension (v0.7.3) including:
- Feature-by-feature comparison table
- 12 identified feature gaps prioritized by user impact
- Implementation recommendations
- Quick wins vs long-term investments

## Methodology

1. Downloaded and extracted Dynamo Tools VSIX package
2. Analyzed package.json (commands, contributes, activation)
3. Reverse-engineered extension.js (2,339 lines of JavaScript)
4. Mapped against BBj Language Server capabilities
5. Prioritized gaps by user impact

## Key Findings

**Extensions are complementary, not competitive:**
- BBj LS: Code intelligence (parsing, diagnostics, navigation, Java interop)
- Dynamo Tools: Metadata completion (Company Libraries, Data Dictionary, called programs)

**High-impact gaps identified:**
1. Called program completion (`call "` trigger)
2. Data Dictionary field completion (`DDNAME.` trigger)
3. Global field completion (`#` trigger)
4. BBjTemplatedString getter/setter completion

**Quick wins (uses existing infrastructure):**
- Global field completion (existing AST)
- Deprecated method indicator (UI enhancement)
- Reopen as BBj command (simple command)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Research-only milestone (no code changes) — Established precedent for analysis milestones
- Reverse engineering approach — Downloaded and extracted VSIX for accurate analysis

**Issues Resolved:**
- N/A (research milestone)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None (no code)
