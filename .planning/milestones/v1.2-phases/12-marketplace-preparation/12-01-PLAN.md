<objective>
Prepare all marketplace metadata, licensing, and Gradle configuration for JetBrains Marketplace submission.

Purpose: The plugin needs complete metadata (description, change notes, vendor info), licensing files (MIT LICENSE, NOTICES for third-party deps), and Gradle verification configuration before it can pass Marketplace approval. This plan creates all the assets and configuration needed for a submission-ready plugin.

Output: Updated description.html with verified feature list, LICENSE and NOTICES files in META-INF, and build.gradle.kts with version 0.1.0, change notes, and plugin verifier configuration.

    **IMPORTANT: Feature verification before writing description.** Before listing ANY feature in description.html or changeNotes, you MUST verify it actually works by checking the codebase for implementation evidence. Do NOT assume features exist. An honest feature list is a locked requirement from CONTEXT.md.

    **Step 0: Verify each candidate feature.** For each feature below, search the codebase for implementation evidence. Only include a feature in the description if you find concrete proof it is implemented:

    - Syntax highlighting: Check for .tmLanguage.json files in the TextMate bundle directories. Verify both BBj and BBx grammars exist.
    - Real-time diagnostics: Check if the language server provides diagnostics (look for "diagnostic" in the LS codebase or check LSP capabilities).
    - Code completion: Check for completion provider implementation in the language server (look for "completion" in LS source).
    - Go-to-definition: Check for definition provider (look for "definition" or "GoToDefinition" in LS source).
    - Hover documentation: Check for hover provider (look for "hover" in LS source).
    - Signature help: Check for signature help provider (look for "signatureHelp" in LS source).
    - Java interop intelligence: Check for Java class completion/resolution in LS source.
    - Run commands (GUI/BUI/DWC): Check for run action implementations in bbj-intellij (these exist from Phase 11).
    - Structure view / document outline: Check if the language server implements `textDocument/documentSymbol`. Search for "documentSymbol" or "DocumentSymbol" in the language server source. If NOT found, do NOT claim Structure view in the description or change notes.
    - Comment toggling: Check for line comment configuration in plugin.xml or language config.
    - Bracket matching: Check for bracket pair configuration in TextMate grammar or plugin config.

    Record which features are verified and which are not. Only verified features go into description.html and changeNotes.

    1. Update `description.html` to include ONLY the verified feature set. Match the tone of the VS Code Marketplace listing but be honest about what's actually implemented. The description must:
       - Open with a brief intro paragraph mentioning this is powered by the same Langium-based language server as the VS Code extension (shared backend credibility per CONTEXT.md decisions)
       - List ONLY features confirmed by codebase evidence in Step 0
       - Include a Requirements section: Node.js 18+ (auto-downloaded if not found), BBj installation (for run commands and Java class completions)
       - Include links to GitHub repo: https://github.com/BBx-Kitchen/bbj-language-server
       - Use ONLY basic HTML tags: p, ul, li, strong, em, a (no script, style, div, span, h1-h6 - Marketplace strips them)
       - Do NOT include screenshots (per CONTEXT.md: text-only for initial submission)

    2. Create `LICENSE` file in META-INF by copying the repo root LICENSE file content verbatim (MIT License, Copyright 2023 BASIS International Ltd.). This ensures the license is included in the plugin distribution ZIP.

    3. Create `NOTICES` file in META-INF documenting third-party dependencies:
       - LSP4IJ: Copyright Red Hat, Inc., Eclipse Public License 2.0 (EPL-2.0), https://github.com/redhat-developer/lsp4ij
       - TextMate Bundles (bbj.tmLanguage.json, bbx.tmLanguage.json): Copyright 2023 BASIS International Ltd., MIT License, from same repo
       - Langium Language Server (main.cjs bundle): Copyright TypeFox GmbH, MIT License, https://github.com/eclipse-langium/langium
       - Use the structure from RESEARCH.md Pattern 4 (separator lines between entries)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Feature verification evidence is documented (which features were confirmed, which were not found)
    - `cat bbj-intellij/src/main/resources/META-INF/description.html` shows feature list containing ONLY verified features
    - If documentSymbol was NOT found in LS source, description.html does NOT mention "Structure view" or "document outline"
    - `cat bbj-intellij/src/main/resources/META-INF/LICENSE` shows MIT License text
    - `cat bbj-intellij/src/main/resources/META-INF/NOTICES` shows LSP4IJ and other dependency attributions
    - No HTML tags beyond p, ul, li, strong, em, a in description.html
  </verify>
  <done>
    description.html lists only features with confirmed codebase implementation evidence, mentions shared VS Code language server backend, and uses only Marketplace-safe HTML tags. LICENSE contains full MIT text. NOTICES documents LSP4IJ (EPL-2.0), TextMate bundles (MIT), and Langium bundle (MIT).

  <name>Task 2: Update build.gradle.kts with version, changeNotes, and pluginVerification</name>
  <files>
    bbj-intellij/build.gradle.kts
  </files>
  <action>
    Update `build.gradle.kts` with three changes:

    1. **Version**: Change `version = "0.1.0-alpha"` to `version = "0.1.0"` (per CONTEXT.md: first Marketplace release version is 0.1.0).

    2. **Change Notes**: Add `changeNotes` to the `pluginConfiguration` block with CDATA-wrapped HTML listing implemented features for the initial 0.1.0 release. Format as a bulleted list under an "0.1.0 - Initial Release" heading. IMPORTANT: Only include features that were verified in Task 1. Use the same verified feature list from description.html -- do NOT add features here that were excluded from the description due to missing implementation evidence.
       Do NOT mention future plans, "coming soon", or "planned" features (per RESEARCH.md Pitfall 6).

    3. **Plugin Verification**: Add `pluginVerification` block to the `intellijPlatform` section. Use `recommended()` for IDE selection (automatically aligns with sinceBuild/untilBuild). Do NOT add custom `failureLevel` configuration - let the default handle it. The Gradle plugin 2.x defaults are sufficient.

    4. **Since-build**: Keep `sinceBuild = "242"` (IntelliJ 2024.2+) as-is. The CONTEXT.md says "2024.1+" but the current build already targets 242 (2024.2) and that's the IDE version in the dependencies block. Keep them aligned. Do NOT change the sinceBuild.

    Important: Do NOT add a `signing` block (signing will happen when user is ready to publish, not now). Do NOT modify the existing copy tasks, prepareSandbox, or runIde configuration.

  <verify>
    - `grep 'version = "0.1.0"' bbj-intellij/build.gradle.kts` matches (no -alpha suffix)
    - `grep -c 'changeNotes' bbj-intellij/build.gradle.kts` returns at least 1
    - `grep -c 'pluginVerification' bbj-intellij/build.gradle.kts` returns at least 1
    - `grep -c 'recommended' bbj-intellij/build.gradle.kts` returns at least 1
    - `cd bbj-intellij && ./gradlew verifyPluginProjectConfiguration` succeeds (validates plugin.xml + Gradle config alignment)
    - changeNotes contains only features that were verified in Task 1
  </verify>
  <done>
    build.gradle.kts has version "0.1.0", changeNotes with initial release feature list (matching verified features only) in CDATA HTML, and pluginVerification with recommended() IDE selection. Gradle project configuration validation passes.

1. All four files exist and contain expected content:
   - `description.html` - verified feature list, shared LS mention, safe HTML only
   - `LICENSE` - MIT License text
   - `NOTICES` - Third-party attributions (LSP4IJ, TextMate, Langium)
   - `build.gradle.kts` - version 0.1.0, changeNotes, pluginVerification
2. Feature lists in description.html and changeNotes match (same verified set)
3. `cd bbj-intellij && ./gradlew verifyPluginProjectConfiguration` passes
4. `cd bbj-intellij && ./gradlew buildPlugin` succeeds and produces distribution ZIP

<success_criteria>
- Plugin description accurately represents only verified implemented features
- License and attribution files are in META-INF for distribution inclusion
- Gradle configuration is complete for Marketplace submission (version, change notes, verifier)
- Plugin builds successfully with updated configuration
