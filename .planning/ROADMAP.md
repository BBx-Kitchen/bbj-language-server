### 🚧 v3.8 Test & Debt Cleanup (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Get the test suite fully green, remove confirmed dead code, and resolve production FIXMEs and actionable TODOs.

- [x] **Phase 54: Fix Failing Tests** - Repair 6 pre-existing test failures covering access-level error messages, DEF FN completion, USE import diagnostics, and cross-file access validation (completed 2026-02-20)
- [ ] **Phase 55: Test Hardening & Dead Code** - Uncomment 9 disabled parser assertions and remove confirmed dead MethodCall CAST branches from type inferer and validator
- [ ] **Phase 56: Production FIXME & TODO Resolution** - Investigate and resolve or document 4 production FIXMEs and 2 actionable TODOs

## Phase Details

### Phase 54: Fix Failing Tests
**Goal**: The test suite runs fully green with all 6 pre-existing failures fixed — either by correcting stale expectations to match current behavior or by fixing the underlying bugs the tests expose.
**Depends on**: Phase 53 (v3.7 complete)
**Requirements**: TEST-01, TEST-02, TEST-03, TEST-04, TEST-05, TEST-06
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `classes.test.ts` private and protected access error messages match the `(declared in ...)` format and pass without modification
  2. DEF FN parameters with `$` suffix complete correctly inside class methods (TEST-03 passes)
  3. USE referencing a file with no classes produces a file-path error diagnostic (TEST-04 passes)
  4. Private instance and static member access across file boundaries are flagged as errors (TEST-05, TEST-06 pass)
  5. `npm test` exits zero with all 6 previously failing tests now green
**Plans**: 2 plans
Plans:
- [ ] 54-01-PLAN.md — Update stale test assertions for class and member access-level error messages (TEST-01, TEST-02, TEST-05, TEST-06)
- [ ] 54-02-PLAN.md — Fix DEF FN completion inside class methods and add USE validation for files with no classes (TEST-03, TEST-04)

### Phase 55: Test Hardening & Dead Code
**Goal**: The parser test file has its 9 disabled assertions re-enabled and passing, and the confirmed dead MethodCall CAST branches are deleted from the type inferer and validator — leaving the codebase smaller and the test suite more complete.
**Depends on**: Phase 54
**Requirements**: HARD-01, DEAD-01, DEAD-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. All 9 previously commented-out `expectNoValidationErrors()` calls in `parser.test.ts` are uncommented and pass
  2. The MethodCall CAST branch is deleted from `bbj-type-inferer.ts` with no test regressions
  3. `checkCastTypeResolvable` for MethodCall is deleted from `bbj-validator.ts` (method body and registration call)
  4. `npm test` continues to exit zero after all deletions
**Plans**: TBD

### Phase 56: Production FIXME & TODO Resolution
**Goal**: Every actionable FIXME and TODO in production code is either resolved with a working implementation or explicitly documented as intentional with a clear rationale — leaving no ambiguous technical debt markers.
**Depends on**: Phase 55
**Requirements**: FIX-01, FIX-02, FIX-03, FIX-04, TODO-01, TODO-02
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. `bbj-linker.ts:74` receiver ref FIXME is resolved or replaced with an explanatory comment documenting why it is intentional
  2. `bbj-scope.ts:209` orphaned AST instances hack is resolved or replaced with a comment explaining the constraint
  3. `java-javadoc.ts:54` javadoc re-trigger FIXME is resolved (re-trigger implemented or deferred with rationale)
  4. `InteropService.java:166` inner class name FIXME is resolved or documented
  5. `bbj-completion-provider.ts:144` TODO-01 is implemented (documentation added to completion item description) or deferred with rationale
  6. `java-interop.ts:78` TODO-02 is implemented (connection failure error sent to client) or deferred with rationale
**Plans**: TBD
