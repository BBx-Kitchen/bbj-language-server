<objective>
Build release artifacts (VS Code .vsix and IntelliJ .jar) as packaging verification, then produce a structured pass/fail verification report for all 9 language features and the IntelliJ build. User manually verifies IntelliJ runtime at checkpoint.

Purpose: This is the final gate before the user publishes. Building artifacts proves the full toolchain works. The verification report maps every FUNC requirement to evidence (automated test results + build output). No version bumps or publishing -- user handles that separately.

Output: Built .vsix and .zip artifacts (not committed), verification report documenting pass/fail for every requirement.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Build release artifacts and produce verification report</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/18-functional-verification-release/18-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md</files>
  <action>
Execute the full build and artifact creation pipeline, then compile a verification report.

**Step 1: Clean build**
```bash
cd /Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-language-server/bbj-vscode
npm run build
```
Verify exit code 0 (tsc + esbuild both succeed). Record output.

**Step 2: Run full test suite**
```bash
cd /Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-language-server/bbj-vscode
npm test
```
Record test results. Note total tests passed vs failed. The functional tests from Plan 01 should be included in this run.

**Step 3: Build VS Code .vsix**
```bash
cd /Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-language-server/bbj-vscode
npx @vscode/vsce package --no-git-tag-version --no-update-package-json
```
Note: Use `--no-git-tag-version` and `--no-update-package-json` to prevent version modifications (user handles versioning). If vsce prompts about LICENSE, ensure LICENSE file exists in bbj-vscode/ (the vscode:prepublish script copies it). If the command fails due to missing LICENSE, run `cp ../LICENSE ./LICENSE` first.

Verify .vsix file is created. Record filename and size. Check that `out/language/main.cjs` is included:
```bash
unzip -l bbj-lang-*.vsix | grep main.cjs
```

**Step 4: Build IntelliJ plugin**
```bash
cd /Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-language-server/bbj-intellij
./gradlew clean buildPlugin
```
Verify BUILD SUCCESSFUL. Check artifact exists in `build/distributions/`. Record filename and size. Verify main.cjs is bundled:
```bash
unzip -l build/distributions/bbj-intellij-*.zip | grep main.cjs
```

**Step 5: Write verification report**

Create `.planning/phases/18-functional-verification-release/18-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# Phase 18: Functional Verification Report

**Date:** [date]
**Branch:** langium_upgrade
**Baseline:** Phase 17 complete (56/58 tests passing)

## Feature Verification

| Req | Feature | Method | Result | Evidence |
|-----|---------|--------|--------|----------|
| FUNC-01 | Syntax highlighting | TextMate grammar (no LS dependency) | PASS/FAIL | bbj.tmLanguage.json unchanged |
| FUNC-02 | Diagnostics | Automated test | PASS/FAIL | lsp-features.test.ts |
| FUNC-03 | BBj completion | Automated test | PASS/FAIL | lsp-features.test.ts |
| FUNC-04 | Java completion | Automated test | PASS/FAIL | lsp-features.test.ts |
| FUNC-05 | Hover info | [method] | PASS/FAIL | [evidence] |
| FUNC-06 | Signature help | [method] | PASS/FAIL | [evidence] |
| FUNC-07 | Go-to-definition | [method] | PASS/FAIL | [evidence] |
| FUNC-08 | Document symbols | Automated test | PASS/FAIL | lsp-features.test.ts |
| FUNC-09 | Semantic tokens | Automated test | PASS/FAIL | [evidence] |
| FUNC-10 | IntelliJ plugin | Build verification + manual | PENDING | User to verify at checkpoint |

## Chevrotain Token Verification

| Token | Standalone | Compound | Result |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------|
| READ | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL |
| INPUT | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL |
| ENTER | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL |
| EXTRACT | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL |
| DELETE | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL |
| SAVE | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL |
| FIND | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL | PASS/FAIL |

## Release Artifacts

| Artifact | Status | File | Size |
|----------|--------|------|------|
| VS Code .vsix | PASS/FAIL | [filename] | [size] |
| IntelliJ .zip | PASS/FAIL | [filename] | [size] |

## Test Suite Summary

- Total tests: [N]
- Passed: [N]
- Failed: [N]
- Known failures: [describe any pre-existing failures]

## Conclusion

[Overall assessment: ready/not-ready for release]
[Any regressions found: none / list]
[Recommendation: proceed with version bump and publish / fix gaps first]
```

Fill in all PASS/FAIL values based on actual test run results and build output. For features not directly tested by automated tests (FUNC-05 hover, FUNC-06 signature help, FUNC-07 go-to-definition), assess based on:
- Whether existing tests in the suite cover the underlying infrastructure (linking, scoping)
- Whether the feature provider code was modified during the upgrade
- Mark as PASS with note "Verified by underlying test coverage" or FAIL with specific issue

IMPORTANT: If ANY feature is FAIL, document it clearly but do NOT attempt to fix it. Per Phase 18 CONTEXT.md: "If a feature doesn't work: route back to Phase 17 as gaps (don't fix in Phase 18)."

  <name>Task 2: IntelliJ runtime verification</name>
  <what-built>
Complete Langium 4 upgrade with:
- All automated functional tests passing (Chevrotain tokens + LSP features)
- VS Code .vsix package built
- IntelliJ .zip plugin built with updated language server bundle

The verification report at `.planning/phases/18-functional-verification-release/18-VERIFICATION-REPORT.md` documents the automated test results.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
IntelliJ runtime testing (FUNC-10). Install the built plugin and verify:

1. Install plugin: IntelliJ > Settings > Plugins > Gear icon > Install Plugin from Disk > select `bbj-intellij/build/distributions/bbj-intellij-*.zip`
2. Open a BBj project or create a new file with `.bbj` extension
3. Verify these features work (no regressions from before the upgrade):
   - [ ] Syntax highlighting: Keywords colored, strings colored, comments colored
   - [ ] Diagnostics: Introduce a syntax error, red squiggle appears
   - [ ] Code completion: Type a partial BBj keyword, completions appear
   - [ ] Hover: Hover over a BBj keyword or variable, info popup appears
   - [ ] Document outline: Structure view shows classes, methods, labels
4. Check the verification report for any FAIL items that need attention

If any feature is broken, describe the issue. These will be routed back as Phase 17 gaps.
