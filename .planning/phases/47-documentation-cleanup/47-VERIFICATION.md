# Phase 47: Documentation Cleanup Verification Report

**Phase Goal:** Documentation site is free of stale content that confuses users
**Verified:** 2026-02-09T20:01:11Z
**Status:** passed
**Re-verification:** No — initial verification

## Goal Achievement

### Observable Truths

| #   | Truth                                                           | Status     | Evidence                                                                      |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Roadmap page does not exist in the docs site                   | ✓ VERIFIED | File deleted, not in build output, no references in docs                      |
| 2   | No broken links remain in the docs site (onBrokenLinks: throw) | ✓ VERIFIED | Config set to 'throw', build succeeds, link format fixed in index pages       |
| 3   | Sidebar shows only VS Code Guide and IntelliJ Guide categories | ✓ VERIFIED | Only intellij/ and vscode/ directories exist, category metadata correct (1,2) |

**Score:** 3/3 truths verified

### Required Artifacts

| Artifact                            | Expected                      | Status     | Details                                                      |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `documentation/docusaurus.config.ts` | onBrokenLinks restored to throw | ✓ VERIFIED | Line 22: `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` — strict link validation active |

### Key Link Verification

| From                       | To                    | Via                                    | Status   | Details                                                         |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| documentation/sidebars.ts  | documentation/docs/   | autogenerated sidebar                  | ✓ WIRED  | Uses `{type: 'autogenerated', dirName: '.'}` — generates from directory structure |
| intellij/index.md links    | intellij/* pages      | Internal links (intellij/page format)  | ✓ WIRED  | Fixed from ./page to intellij/page format (commit 6ec388d)      |
| vscode/index.md links      | vscode/* pages        | Internal links (vscode/page format)    | ✓ WIRED  | Fixed from ./page.md to vscode/page format (commit 6ec388d)     |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status      | Blocking Issue |
| ----------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| CLEAN-01    | ✓ SATISFIED | None - roadmap.md deleted, not in build output |
| CLEAN-02    | ✓ SATISFIED | None - developer-guide/ directory does not exist (removed in Phase 44) |
| CLEAN-03    | ✓ SATISFIED | None - sidebar autogenerated from clean directory structure (only intellij/ and vscode/) |

### Anti-Patterns Found

No anti-patterns detected. All files are clean production code with no TODO/FIXME comments, no placeholder content, and proper link formatting validated by successful build.

### Human Verification Required

None. All verification completed programmatically via file existence checks, grep patterns, category metadata inspection, and successful Docusaurus build with strict link checking enabled.

---

## Detailed Verification Evidence

### Truth 1: Roadmap page does not exist

**File existence check:**
```bash
ls documentation/docs/roadmap.md
# Result: NOT_FOUND
```

**Build output check:**
```bash
find documentation/build -name "*roadmap*"
# Result: No matches (empty output)
```

**Reference check:**
```bash
grep -ri "roadmap" documentation/docs/
# Result: No matches
```

**Conclusion:** Roadmap page completely removed. CLEAN-01 satisfied.

### Truth 2: No broken links remain

**Config verification:**
```typescript
// documentation/docusaurus.config.ts:22
onBrokenLinks: 'throw',
```

**Build verification:**
```
npm run build
[SUCCESS] Generated static files in "build".
```

Build completed successfully with `onBrokenLinks: 'throw'` — any broken internal link would have failed the build.

**Link format fixes (commit 6ec388d):**
- IntelliJ index: Changed `./getting-started` to `intellij/getting-started`
- VS Code index: Changed `./getting-started.md` to `vscode/getting-started`

These fixes were necessary when strict checking was enabled. The broken links existed before Phase 47 but were masked by `onBrokenLinks: 'warn'` setting during Phase 44 restructuring.

**Conclusion:** All internal links valid. CLEAN-03 satisfied.

### Truth 3: Sidebar shows only VS Code and IntelliJ guides

**Directory structure:**
```bash
ls documentation/docs/
# Result: intellij  vscode
```

**Category metadata:**

`documentation/docs/vscode/_category_.json`:
```json
{
  "label": "VS Code Guide",
  "position": 1,
  "collapsed": false,
  "link": {"type": "doc", "id": "vscode/index"}
}
```

`documentation/docs/intellij/_category_.json`:
```json
{
  "label": "IntelliJ Guide",
  "position": 2,
  "collapsed": false,
  "link": {"type": "doc", "id": "intellij/index"}
}
```

**Build output:**
```bash
ls documentation/build/docs/
# Result: intellij  intellij.html  vscode  vscode.html
```

**Developer guide check:**
```bash
ls documentation/docs/developer-guide/
# Result: NOT_FOUND (removed in Phase 44)
```

**Conclusion:** Clean sidebar structure with only two categories. CLEAN-02 and CLEAN-03 satisfied.

## Commit Verification

All commits from SUMMARY.md verified in git log:

1. **19f8c09** - `chore(47-01): remove stale roadmap and restore strict link checking`
   - Deleted documentation/docs/roadmap.md
   - Changed onBrokenLinks from 'warn' to 'throw'

2. **6ec388d** - `fix(47-01): correct broken links in index pages`
   - Fixed IntelliJ index links from `./page` to `intellij/page` format
   - Fixed VS Code index links from `./page.md` to `vscode/page` format

Both commits present in repository history.

---

## Summary

Phase 47 goal **ACHIEVED**. The documentation site is free of stale content:

- Roadmap page removed entirely (no file, no build output, no references)
- Developer Guide already removed in Phase 44 (directory does not exist)
- Sidebar shows only VS Code Guide and IntelliJ Guide categories
- All internal links validated by successful build with strict checking
- Link format bugs discovered and fixed during verification
- All three CLEAN requirements satisfied

The phase also improved documentation quality by fixing broken link formats in index pages that were masked by the temporary 'warn' setting during Phase 44 restructuring.
