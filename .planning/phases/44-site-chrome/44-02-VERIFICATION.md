### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Description                                                     | Status       | Evidence                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| SITE-01     | Tagline updated to cover both VS Code and IntelliJ             | ✓ SATISFIED  | Tagline: "Language intelligence for BBj dev"    |
| SITE-02     | JetBrains Marketplace link in navbar and footer                | ✓ SATISFIED  | Present in navbar (line 78-82), footer (145-148) |

| SITE-04     | Landing page references both IDEs with equal marketplace links | ✓ SATISFIED  | Three hero buttons with equal styling            |

### Anti-Patterns Found

No anti-patterns detected.

- ✓ No TODO/FIXME/PLACEHOLDER comments
- ✓ No stub implementations
- ✓ No empty handlers or console-only code
- ✓ All links point to valid paths or external URLs
- ✓ IntelliJ stubs are intentional (Phase 45 will populate)

### Human Verification Required

#### 1. Visual Layout: Three Hero Buttons

**Test:** Open `/Users/beff/_workspace/bbj-language-server/documentation/build/index.html` in browser (or deployed site)
**Expected:** Three buttons appear side-by-side with equal visual weight. "Get Started", "VS Code Marketplace", and "JetBrains Marketplace" all use the same styling class (`button--secondary button--lg`).
**Why human:** CSS rendering and visual balance require human review.

#### 2. Navbar Appearance: Dual-IDE Presentation

**Test:** Check navbar on deployed site or local server (`npm run serve`)
**Expected:** Left side shows "VS Code Guide" and "IntelliJ Guide" as separate items. Right side shows GitHub, VS Code Marketplace, and JetBrains Marketplace icons/links.
**Why human:** Navbar layout and responsive behavior need visual verification.

#### 3. Footer Structure: Three Column Layout

**Test:** Scroll to footer on any docs page
**Expected:** Three columns labeled "VS Code Guide", "IntelliJ Guide", and "Resources". Each has 4 links. Resources includes both marketplace links.
**Why human:** Footer layout and link appearance require visual check.

#### 4. External Links Functionality

**Test:** Click JetBrains Marketplace link in navbar and footer
**Expected:** Opens `https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/com.basis.bbj` in new tab/window
**Why human:** External navigation behavior verification.

#### 5. Get Started Button Navigation

**Test:** Click "Get Started" button on landing page hero
**Expected:** Navigates to `/docs/vscode/getting-started` page
**Why human:** Internal routing verification.

## Summary

Phase 44 goal **ACHIEVED**. All must-haves verified:

✓ Site title changed from "BBj Language Server" to "BBj Language Support"
✓ Tagline is IDE-neutral ("Language intelligence for BBj development")
✓ Navbar presents "VS Code Guide" and "IntelliJ Guide" as separate, equal items
✓ Navbar right side includes GitHub, VS Code Marketplace, and JetBrains Marketplace
✓ Developer Guide completely removed from navbar and footer
✓ Footer has three columns with equal presentation of both IDE guides
✓ Footer Resources includes JetBrains Marketplace alongside VS Code Marketplace
✓ Landing page hero has three buttons with equal visual weight
✓ Feature cards explicitly reference "VS Code or IntelliJ" where relevant
✓ Developer Commands card reflects actual v3.x commands (run GUI/BUI/DWC, refresh Java) without phantom "decompile" reference

**Artifacts:** All exist, substantive, and wired correctly.
**Key Links:** All verified — navbar links to IDE directories, hero button to getting-started, marketplace links external.
**Requirements:** All 4 SITE requirements satisfied.
**Build:** Docusaurus build succeeds with only expected warning (roadmap → developer-guide link will be addressed in Phase 47).

**Commits verified:**
- `f65a673` — Site config updates
- `437ccf0` — Landing page updates

**Human verification recommended** for visual layout, responsive behavior, and external link navigation.
