<objective>
Audit the VS Code Features and Getting Started pages to remove phantom features, correct the file types table, and verify installation steps.

Purpose: Ensure the VS Code user guide accurately reflects the current extension capabilities (VSCA-01, VSCA-04, VSCA-05).
Output: Two updated documentation pages with accurate content.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Audit and update Features page</name>
  <files>documentation/docs/vscode/features.md</files>
  <action>
Read the current features.md and bbj-vscode/package.json. Make these targeted edits:

1. **Build Commands table (line ~99-106):** Remove the Decompile row entirely. The `bbj.decompile` command does NOT exist in package.json. Keep only Compile and Denumber.

2. **File Support table (line ~140-146):** Replace the current table with an accurate one based on package.json `contributes.languages[0].extensions` which registers `.bbj`, `.bbjt`, `.src`, `.bbx`:

| Extension | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `.bbj` | BBj source files |
| `.bbjt` | BBj template files |
| `.src` | BBj source files (legacy) |
| `.bbx` | BBx configuration files |
| `.bbl` | BBj library files (syntax highlighting only; excluded from code intelligence features) |

The `.bbl` row must note that `.bbl` files are recognized by the grammar but excluded from workspace indexing, so they get syntax highlighting but not completions, diagnostics, or navigation.

3. **Developer Commands section (line ~89-112):** In the "Configuration Commands" list, verify all items exist in package.json commands. They do: `bbj.config`, `bbj.properties`, `bbj.em`, `bbj.showClasspathEntries`. Keep as-is.

4. **Editor Context Menu section / Explorer Context Menu:** Remove any mention of Decompile from context menus if present (check the bottom of the file near "Context Menus" if such a section exists within features.md).

Do NOT add new features to this page (that is handled by plan 46-02 for configuration). This task focuses on removing phantom features and correcting file types.
  </action>
  <verify>
Grep the updated features.md for "Decompile" or "decompile" — must return zero matches.
Grep for ".src" — must return at least one match.
Grep for ".bbl" — must return at least one match mentioning exclusion from code intelligence.
  </verify>
  <done>Features page has no Decompile references, file types table includes all five extensions (.bbj, .bbjt, .src, .bbx, .bbl) with .bbl exclusion note.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify and update Getting Started page</name>
  <files>documentation/docs/vscode/getting-started.md</files>
  <action>
Read the current getting-started.md and verify each section against actual extension behavior from package.json:

1. **Prerequisites:** Verify VS Code version (1.67.0+ per package.json engines — correct). BBj 25.00+ — correct. Java 17+ — correct. Keep as-is.

2. **Installation section:** Verify marketplace link and VSIX instructions. Both are accurate. Keep as-is.

3. **Initial Configuration — "Enable BBj Language Service" section:** This section references enabling a server component in Enterprise Manager. Verify this is still accurate for BBj 25.00. Keep as-is (this is a BBj server-side requirement, not an extension setting).

4. **Setting BBj Home:** Verify `bbj.home` setting exists in package.json — it does. The default is `null` in package.json but docs say the path. This is correct (user must set it). Keep as-is.

5. **Configuring Classpath:** Docs show `"bbj.classpath": "default"` but package.json has `"default": "bbj_default"`. Update the example to use `"bbj_default"` to match the actual default value. Also update the description text to mention running "BBj: Show Available Classpath Entries" to see options, matching the setting description in package.json.

6. **Running Your First Program:** Lists Alt+G, Alt+B, Alt+D — all correct per package.json keybindings. Keep as-is.

7. **Java Integration Not Working section:** References "java-interop" directory and gradlew. This is an internal detail not relevant to VS Code extension users (the extension manages this automatically). Simplify to say the Java interop service starts automatically with the extension and requires BBjServices running with proper bbj.home configuration. Remove the manual gradlew command.

8. **Next Steps:** Links to Features and Configuration pages — keep as-is.
  </action>
  <verify>
Read the updated getting-started.md. Verify:
- Classpath example shows "bbj_default" not "default"
- No manual gradlew instructions remain
- All linked pages still use correct relative paths
  </verify>
  <done>Getting Started page has correct classpath default value and no misleading manual service instructions.</done>
</task>

1. `grep -i "decompile" documentation/docs/vscode/features.md` returns nothing
2. `grep "\.src" documentation/docs/vscode/features.md` returns at least one match
3. `grep "\.bbl" documentation/docs/vscode/features.md` returns a match with exclusion note
4. `grep "bbj_default" documentation/docs/vscode/getting-started.md` returns at least one match
5. No broken internal links (relative paths to ./features, ./configuration still valid)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Features page lists only Compile and Denumber in Build Commands (no Decompile)
- File types table documents all five extensions with .bbl exclusion note
- Getting Started page uses correct classpath default and has no misleading manual service instructions
- Requirements VSCA-01 (partial: phantom removal + file types), VSCA-04, VSCA-05 addressed
</success_criteria>
